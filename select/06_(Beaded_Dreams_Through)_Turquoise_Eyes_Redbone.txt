Love tell me wove together
Makes for happy years life's
Beaded dreams are better made, in see through turquoise eyes

Can me see, can me see

Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes
Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes
Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes

When the earth, meet's sky, all around all around,
Time and space in the twine, to the sounds,
We had fun, mount to love, barefoot, troubles lifes

If you just, come and see me

Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes
Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes
Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes

To the lake, to the sea, to the well,
All the flow, if you let her come on go
Come and see me, come and see me

Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes
Beaded dreams are better made, in see through turquoise eyes

Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes
Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes
Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes
Beaded dreams through turquoise eyes

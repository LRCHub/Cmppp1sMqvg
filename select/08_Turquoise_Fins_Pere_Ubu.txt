Can't we stop along the way?
We just passed by a place called
Elvis Is Alive Museum
And a Shop
Where
We can get souvenirs & a postcard or two

Jack says
Man it's awful hard
To be the one
That everyone was waiting for
It's lonely in the dark
When
Media priests of the Big Lie
Own
All of the words

Did you ever wonder why
Your Elvis fans
Were so much nicer people than
The people who
Laugh at
Them?
